Facial Emotion Recognition Through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This project is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize and classify facial emotions in real-time. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision, the system detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality, with potential applications in mental health monitoring, customer behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction.

Features

	•	Emotion Detection: Detects and classifies facial emotions from images and live video feeds.
	•	Real-Time Processing: Processes video streams in real-time using OpenCV and AI models.
	•	Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes face detection, landmark recognition, resizing, and normalization for consistent input data.
	•	Robust Deep Learning Model: Trained on a large dataset of facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy and reliability.
	•	Data Augmentation: Enhances the model’s robustness by mitigating overfitting and addressing dataset imbalances.
	•	User Interface: Displays emotion predictions with confidence scores in a user-friendly visualization.
	•	Scalable Backend: Built with Flask to support seamless integration with external systems.
	•	Ethical AI: Incorporates diverse datasets and considers data privacy to minimize bias and ensure fairness.
